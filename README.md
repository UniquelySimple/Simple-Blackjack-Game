# Simple-Blackjack-Game
Blackjack is a popular card game where players compete against the dealer to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Each player starts with two cards and can choose to hit (draw more cards) or stand (keep their hand). Face cards are worth 10, and aces can be 1 or 11. The goal is to have a higher total than the dealer without busting.
